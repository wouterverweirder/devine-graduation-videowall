[{"id":2,"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Anseele","description":"This project deals with the important topic of education around the proper handling of dogs. Communication between dogs and their owners is often underestimated and this is especially a concern for parents with young children. Education of general knowledge on how to handle dogs would lead to peace of mind with the parents.\nTo find a solution to this challenge I have visited an animal shelter in Ostend, and I have learned more in 3 hours than a week of researching best practices on the internet. \nHow could I make sure that children would be able to acquire that general and actually simple knowledge like the information I had gained? I tackled this through creating the concept of an app in which children can read unique stories (based on facts) combined with educational exercises.","bio":"I've loved designing since I was a child. That ranged from placing colored cubes in a certain way in kindergarten, enthusiastically designing powerpoints in elementary school to designing posters, logos, sweaters and so on in secondary school. After high school I decided totake my passion for design into my hands not only as a hobby but also as work.In Devine you have the great advantage of being able to experience so many different things.You learn about coding, storytelling, animation, research, illustration, photoshopping, copywriting and so much more.I love variety and this is something Devine has certainly given me in recent years. Towards the future I definitely want to keep that variation, experimentation and to keepon learning new things.I loveto take on a challenge.","published_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:42.000Z","created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:37.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T07:29:49.000Z","profilePicture":{"id":12,"name":"Julia_Anseele.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Julia_Anseele.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":4.3,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b.jpg"}},"hash":"Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":222.1,"url":"/uploads/Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:25:31.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:25:31.000Z"},"assets":[{"id":14,"name":"Photo_landscape_2.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2_56d3d61446","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":6.23,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2_56d3d61446.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_2_56d3d61446","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":836.34,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_2_56d3d61446.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:21.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:21.000Z"},{"id":15,"name":"Photo_landscape_1.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1_3f2a667c15","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":4.13,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1_3f2a667c15.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_1_3f2a667c15","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":983.57,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_1_3f2a667c15.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:21.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:22.000Z"},{"id":16,"name":"Photo_portrait_1.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1_ce18434175","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":3.06,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1_ce18434175.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_1_ce18434175","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":802.96,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_1_ce18434175.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:22.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:22.000Z"},{"id":17,"name":"Photo_portrait_3.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3_889f0d8a05","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":4.08,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3_889f0d8a05.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_3_889f0d8a05","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2131.4,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_3_889f0d8a05.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:23.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:23.000Z"},{"id":18,"name":"Photo_landscape_3.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3_9d3810e179","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":7.44,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3_9d3810e179.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_3_9d3810e179","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2322.14,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_3_9d3810e179.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:23.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:24.000Z"},{"id":19,"name":"Photo_portrait_2.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2_45b91ac781","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":3.41,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2_45b91ac781.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_2_45b91ac781","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2521.32,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_2_45b91ac781.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:24.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:25.000Z"},{"id":20,"name":"video1.mp4","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":null,"height":null,"formats":null,"hash":"video1_2e64805ad6","ext":".mp4","mime":"video/mp4","size":3500.6,"url":"/uploads/video1_2e64805ad6.mp4","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:26.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:26.000Z"},{"id":21,"name":"video2.mp4","alternativeText":"","caption":"","

I created a world in space based on the idea of an adventure into space, but with a feel-good vibe. You can compare it to an Indiana Jones adventure — instead of visualising space as  dark and empty as often seen in sci-fi films.","bio":"I’m a designer with a big focus on graphic design and love for typography.

Since I’ve been playing games all my life, I’ve also always been interested in how they’re made. I used this project to expand my knowledge in game development. Creating a game is hard work, depending on the genre of the game you choose you could be working on it for multiple years. My game is in one of the genres that would take a few years to develop, an open-world RPG. I was not deterred by this ambitious task and started to develop. The end result can be seen as a prototype, not as a full working game. However, I am very with the result as I started with zero knowledge and now can create a game from scratch.","bio":"I’ve always loved to learn more, do more, experience more.

As a part of the LGBTQ+ community I wanted to support young LGBTQ+ athletes in their sports environment. I tried doing so by creating an online social awareness campaign which targets straight, athletic youngsters between the age of 13 and 18. \nMost of the time we fear what we don’t know. Therefore, I wanted to inform my target audience in a fun and casual manner. I created a storytelling mini-game exclusively for mobile. Throughout the mini-game I present the user with situations and choices. By showing them the outcome of these choices I hope to create awareness around the impact of homophobic behaviour on the wellbeing of young LGBTQ+ athletes. Knowing the required engagement is pretty high for my target audience I’ve also focused a lot on the way the campaign is marketed. On top of informing myself on social media marketing I created AR Instagram filters to spread my message in an online word to mouth manner to gather attention. \nBeing publicly gay, bi or trans in a sport environment is still a taboo. I hope to change the hearts and minds of the sports community by targeting the next generation.","bio":"As a young adult It took me quite some time to figure out what I really wanted to do in life.

My goal was to make a fitting environment for the show that could be used in the live show. I focused on an abstract look & feel that could easily be associated with Ketnet. A colourful visual where lots of elements, linked with the theme of the award, were represented. \nThe final product was a landscape of an extraterrestrial planet. In the middle of this landscape, you could find a stage where the presentation of the awards took place. The stage is submerged in the theme of the award that was being presented. I chose the award of “Song of the year”.","bio":"After three years trying to understand the digital world with the help of code and design, I developed myown personal vision on what defines a digital creative. With animation, illustration, UI/UX design andmany more skills in my bag, I focus on designing creative experiences & innovative services. I try my bestto be more than a designer. A visual artist, a listener, a problem solver but most of all, a partner you’dwork twice with!","published_at":"2021-06-01T15:21:05.000Z","created_at":"2021-06-01T15:21:00.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-07T07:32:26.000Z","profilePicture":{"id":69,"name":"Devine Graduation Show - Mathias De
