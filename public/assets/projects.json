[{"id":2,"firstName":"Julia","lastName":"Anseele","description":"This project deals with the important topic of education around the proper handling of dogs. Communication between dogs and their owners is often underestimated and this is especially a concern for parents with young children. Education of general knowledge on how to handle dogs would lead to peace of mind with the parents.\nTo find a solution to this challenge I have visited an animal shelter in Ostend, and I have learned more in 3 hours than a week of researching best practices on the internet. \nHow could I make sure that children would be able to acquire that general and actually simple knowledge like the information I had gained? I tackled this through creating the concept of an app in which children can read unique stories (based on facts) combined with educational exercises.","bio":"I've loved designing since I was a child. From placing coloured cubes in kindergarten, designing PowerPoints in elementary school to designing posters, logos and sweaters in secondary school. I decided to turn my passion for design into my career. During my studies, I took advantage of being able to experience many different facets of the profession. Coding, storytelling, animation, research, illustration or copywriting - I loved the variety. This is also something I’d want to keep in the future. I love experimentation and taking on a challenge.","published_at":"2021-06-21T11:03:59.000Z","created_at":"2021-05-13T14:27:37.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T11:04:00.000Z","expert":{"id":1,"name":"Design","published_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:14.000Z","created_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:10.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:14.000Z"},"profilePicture":{"id":12,"name":"Julia_Anseele.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Julia_Anseele.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":156,"height":156,"size":4.3,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b.jpg"}},"hash":"Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":222.1,"url":"/uploads/Julia_Anseele_bbeb04003b.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T14:25:31.000Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T14:25:31.000Z"},"assets":[{"id":137,"name":"Photo_landscape_2.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2_6311daab4d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":6.23,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_2_6311daab4d.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_2_6311daab4d","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":836.34,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_2_6311daab4d.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:00.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:00.000Z"},{"id":138,"name":"Photo_portrait_1.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1_841c7bbccb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":3.06,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_1_841c7bbccb.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_1_841c7bbccb","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":802.96,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_1_841c7bbccb.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:00.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:01.000Z"},{"id":139,"name":"Photo_landscape_3.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3_e4b960ed36","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":7.44,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_3_e4b960ed36.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_3_e4b960ed36","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2322.14,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_3_e4b960ed36.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:01.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:01.000Z"},{"id":140,"name":"Photo_landscape_1.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1920,"height":1080,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1_6ce34ba638","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":245,"height":138,"size":4.13,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_landscape_1_6ce34ba638.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_landscape_1_6ce34ba638","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":983.57,"url":"/uploads/Photo_landscape_1_6ce34ba638.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:01.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:02.000Z"},{"id":141,"name":"Photo_portrait_3.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3_10b5be54b9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":4.08,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_3_10b5be54b9.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_3_10b5be54b9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2131.4,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_3_10b5be54b9.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:02.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:02.000Z"},{"id":142,"name":"Photo_portrait_2.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1080,"height":1920,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2_dc66d9170b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":88,"height":156,"size":3.41,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Photo_portrait_2_dc66d9170b.jpg"}},"hash":"Photo_portrait_2_dc66d9170b","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":2521.32,"url":"/uploads/Photo_portrait_2_dc66d9170b.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:03.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-08T18:32:03.000Z"},{"id":143,"name":"video2_1.mp4","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":null,"height":null,"formats":null,"hash":"video2_1_4799d2a1ac","ext":".mp4","mime":"video/mp4","size":2526.11,"url":"/uploads/video2_1_4799d2a1ac.mp4","previewUrl":null,"provider":"aws-s3",

is something intriguing as it’s deeply personal but yet also impressionable by others. Our identity defines our place and meaning on this globe. Our identity is stored in its purest form in our DNA. Our DNA holds the code to who we are and plays a big part in what makes us, us. \n\nIf we would be able to change our DNA and thus who we are, that would be scary, right? In 2012, this technology was developed: CRISPR is able to make irreversible changes to our DNA, with the potential to cure hereditary diseases but also to change human characteristics such as intelligence and strength. This is life-changing and ethically challenging. And yet, not many people know CRISPR.\n\nTherefore, I created a mobile awareness campaign to reach young people, as they are most likely to be confronted with this technology in their future.\nI draw this generation characterised by FOMO with my tagline “the ball is rolling” (a dutch saying for something is happening) to give them the feeling that they’re missing out. The ball metaphorically guides them through the campaign where they get sensitised interactively and where the story is told accessible in a full visual 3D-environment.

As a people-person, I get a lot of inspiration from connections between humans. Everything interaction-based, from design to development, sparks my interest.

They asked to create a digital world in which the hosts and guests could present the show.\n\nI started the proces with research about stage design as a base. Through this project I wanted to expand my skills and knowledge of cinema 4d (3D software). \n\nThe theme of the show is “space, the final frontier”. I created a world in space based on the idea of an adventure into space, but with a feel-good vibe. You can compare it to an Indiana Jones adventure — instead of visualising space as  dark and empty as often seen in sci-fi films.\n","bio":"I am designer with a fascination for graphic design and a love for typography.

Creating a game is hard work, depending on the genre of the game you choose you could be working on it for multiple years. \n\nMy game is in one of the genres that would take a few years to develop, an open-world RPG. I was not deterred by this ambitious task and started to develop. The end result can be seen as a prototype, not as a full working game. However, I am very with the result as I started with zero knowledge and now can create a game from scratch.\n\n","bio":"I’ve always loved to learn more, do more, experience more.

Schepper","description":"For this project I wanted to work on a topic that I really care about. As a part of the LGBTQ+ community I wanted to support young LGBTQ+ athletes in their sports environment. I tried doing so by creating an online social awareness campaign which targets straight, athletic youngsters between the age of 13 and 18.\n\nMost of the time we fear what we don’t know. Therefore, I wanted to inform my target audience in a fun and casual manner. I created a storytelling mini-game exclusively for mobile. Throughout the mini-game I present the user with situations and choices. By showing them the outcome of these choices I hope to create awareness around the impact of homophobic behaviour on the wellbeing of young LGBTQ+ athletes. \n\nKnowing the required engagement is pretty high for my target audience I’ve also focused a lot on the way the campaign is marketed. On top of informing myself on social media marketing I created AR Instagram filters to spread my message in an online word to mouth manner to gather attention. \n\nBeing publicly gay, bi or trans in a sport environment is still a taboo. I hope to change the hearts and minds of the sports community by targeting the next generation. ","bio":"As a young adult it took me some time to figure out what I wanted to do in life. When I started at Devine, I truly found my calling. I love to design but I think one of my greatest skills is creative, conceptual thinking. This is also why I love digital storytelling. My dream job would be in an agency where I could work on a project from start to finish with the help of team. Especially advertisements and branding I find most interesting since I love to come up with ideas and translate these into a digital, creative story.","published_at":"2021-06-01T14:55:29.000Z","created_at":"2021-06-01T14:55:26.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T13:23:11.000Z","expert":{"id":1,"name":"Design","published_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:14.000Z","created_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:10.000Z","updated_at":"2021-06-11T07:41:14.000Z"},"profilePicture":{"id":59,"name":"Devine

This year there needed to be an alternative. They asked us to create a digital world  where the presenters would present from.\nMy goal was to provide an environment that fits in the theme of this year’s show, it was called ‘Space The Final Frontier’. \n\nCinema 4D was the tool of choice for this project. I tried to find my own personal style within 3D design while learning lots of new features and workflows. The progression was a huge part of the process. My goal was to make a fitting environment for the show that could be used in the live show. I focused on an abstract look & feel that could easily be associated with Ketnet. A colourful visual where lots of elements, linked with the theme of the award, were represented. \n\nThe final product was a landscape of an extraterrestrial planet. In the middle of this landscape, you could find a stage where the presentation of the awards took place. The stage is submerged in the theme of the award that was being presented. I chose the award of “Song of the year”.","bio":"After three years trying to understand the digital world with the help of code and design, I developed my own personal vision on what defines a digital creative.

The message hidden in the project is \"talking about feelings is daring and tough\". The starting point of this project is the problem that young people, more specifically boys, do not talk about their feelings because of the prevailing stigmatization that exists in the society in which they grow up. \n\nAs a potential solution to this problem, an interactive mobile storytelling experience was developed to tell the story of a boy named Zeno. He is a boy with a strong character who can appear very aggressive but deep down he is looking for a little luck. From the age of 15 he has been living in a youth institute. His bossy and bullying behaviour comes out on the streets, but once alone in his room, loneliness soon returns. This changes when he meets Dusa on an ordinary school day. Through Dusa, Zeno discovers that the only solution to finding his happiness is to talk about his problems, but will he?","bio":"Throughout my Devine studies I have developed a passion for animation and motion design.

project focusses on communication differences between the major cultural groups and how the slightest detail can lead to misunderstanding between the two parties. Exposure to other cultures does not always lead to more understanding. We tend to relapse on our own cultural values to try and understand communication patterns within foreign cultures. \n\nThe project gives us the ability to explore these major cultures through a multicultural interactive global village which is the depiction of today’s globalized world. Different small stories, supported by serious gaming, can be played out within the village where I present the player with split second choices he or she has to make to avoid misunderstanding. Gradually the player will start recognizing the varying communication patterns and styles which he or she can reuse in new stories which emerge in the global village. \n\nIn that way players are much more prepared for real life intercultural situations. They are able to apply the right communication style for the corresponding culture without relying on its own cultural values. \n","bio":"Throughout Devine I have learned to constantly ask myself who am I creating forand why.

project is devoted to hip hop, specifically West-Flemish hip hop. It appears that hip hop culture in West-Flanders isn’t recognized as much as it wants to be. As a hip hop lover, I challenged myself to digitally indulge the young hip hoppers in a heap of culture. The final result of this project is a digital web experience that showcases the atmosphere, the music and the talent you can find in the heart of our own city. I challenged myself with learning cell animation from scratch, designing characters and most importantly to create a true experience.","bio":"Ever since I’ve started my Devine career back in 2018, I feel like my passion and respect for digital content has skyrocketed.

Through interviews with diehard Amenra I fans I could conclude that their on-location shows (e.g. in a church or abandoned industrial zone) created a superior experience as compared to club shows. On-location visitors instantly felt the atmosphere of the location chosen specifically for that concert. Amenra opts for dark locations and makes sure that their tripod logo is all around you.\n\nThrough my project I wanted to make sure people would feel the same vibe at a club show. My goal was to make you experience the Amenra atmosphere through 360° projection. I chose to work with 3D animations in a room where visuals are projected from the back and front as well as left and right. The visitor should get the full experience from the moment they enter the concert hall. Therefore I created a room that is kind of like the real life Church of Ra. Slow animations move all around you. This creates a mystical vibe that prepares and excites the guest before the real show. I submerged myself in 3D animation, projection, spatial awareness and storytelling. Or better said: in building an atmosphere.","bio":"I’m inspired by weird sh*t and I like to make cool projects.

Every year they host an award-show similar to the Grammy's and the Oscars. This year's theme was space. I was responsible for the teaser-campaign. I came up with the idea to make spaceships that match with a category that would weekly land, crash, or do something unique in a city in Belgium prior to the event. These events would be captured by passersby and posted on social media such as Instagram and TikTok and their own news-channel Karrewiet which eventually would be tied back to the award show. \n\nI wanted to learn more about C4D, VFX, and CGI. I had just learned about C4D and it was an amazing experience. I had never worked with self-made footage before so going outside and filming to make my videos was a whole new encounter. \n\nAfter all, this project was all about learning new stuff and I absolutely did learn a lot of new things. My workflow in C4D has increased immensely in speed, I learned new techniques in both C4D and AE and it is a great start for a new path. \n","bio":"I always was doing something creative. I drew a lot, made silly designs for streamers and YouTubers and loved to make fan art.

With my web application I aimed to find a solution to bring family and friends together in a digital way. Exploring different possibilities on how to still get the Christmas spirit through digital solutions, I came up with the idea to let people share their Christmas wishes in a fun and unique way. \n\nI created a web application that gives the opportunity to create your own digital Christmas tree and giving the user an immersive experience through 2D & 3D web animations combined with smooth UX. Each tree can be decorated with baubles that contain your Christmas wish. This way family and friends are still able to decorate their Christmas tree together in a safe environment! \n","bio":"I am a twenty-something not-your-average student with great ambitions and - if possible - greater love and passion for design and development.

project started from my passion for programming. I wanted to explore something new and decided to dive into the world of live coding, creating both music and visuals. I find it a really interesting idea to make people dance to code. It’s fun to think about, as you are creating an emotional interaction or connection with the people around through written code. \n\nI created two versions that are my own interpretation of opposites in emotion. The music is made to create an atmosphere supported by visuals which react to the music that is being played. It allows people to experience live coding briefly and see what some of the many possibilities are. I aspired to learn the new languages and master them so I would be able to play with code and create what I want. I find it extremely interesting and it will be something I return to in the future.","bio":"While every day I debate with myself about what my preference is (research, design or development), I experiment and enjoy myself within all aspects.

In this way, the child can also work on its grieving process during the week.\n \nThe app acts as a virtual room that the child can enter. Inside the room there are 4 main features. The first feature is ‘saving memories’, as keeping track of memories is necessary to facilitate the grieving process. \n\nThe second feature aims to improve the communication between parent and child. Children can shut down during the grieving process, making communication between the parent and the child more difficult. The app helps the child to communicate with the parent. The third features tracks emotions and is useful for a counselor. The fourth feature provides books that teaches children that it is okay to be angry, sad or scared.","bio":"Throughout my Devine years I have become fascinated by design that solve problems.

lives were completely turned upside down in 2020 as a result of the pandemic, bringing serious consequences. Students were forced to take online classes and suddenly lost all social contact, causing many young people to face problems they had never experienced before that took a heavy toll on their mental health. Suddenly, a large part of this group no longer has any structure in their lives, feel lonely, have stress or anxiety, deal with unknown emotions, etc... But even before Covid, 1 out of 5 young people were already struggling with their mental health. \n\nThat's why I decided to create bubblÿ: a virtual friend that will help you face these issues together. Vent your emotions, understand them, change how you feel. And when it doesn't work for a while he will give you that little push when you need it. The application is full of features trying to tackle the most common issues during Covid. One of my main focuses of this project was the tone of voice. I wanted to bring back some joy, fighting a serious theme with some humor but also kindness and empathy. We’re going through this together each with our own struggles and I really think this platform could make a change. \n","bio":"A wise man once said “If you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life” and I think that’s beautiful. It’s sad that I still haven’t found it though. I’m totally kidding, haha. I actually found this right here and I’m so glad I did. Throughout Devine, digital design actually turned from an interest into a passion and its still growing every day. Being a creative is actually a way to express my emotions. I’m in love with minimalistic design: less is more, you know. Unless we’re talking about alcoho... - never mind.

had the great opportunity to create a project for JEF Festival. I used a Xbox 360 Kinect Sensor toi create an interactive gesture game for children between 6 and 12 years old. The project centers around bees and the danger of their extinction. I wanted to put the importance of the bee in the spotlight. Children can explore the world and the threats to bees. This experience allows children to discover the adventure on their own or with a friend.","bio":"I have a passion for experimental installations and creative development. Getting people to experience new technologies supported by design is what motivates me. I will always be interested in new kinds of interactions and technologies. I’m delighted I found this passion and can make a career out of
