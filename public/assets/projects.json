            "description": "\"We need a digital product to get kids outside more.\" is the answer we have for \"how do we get kids outside more?\". Using kids' already familiar digital-environment to get them into nature is something that is a normal now and without forcing them to learn anything they can explore everything at their own pace and with a slight challenge. By using elements in nature like trees, dirt and water and blending them with digital challenges we create a new environment, a multi layered environment. We use this approach because we want those kids to embrace nature, but without compromising technology as it can benefit in so many more ways than we know at this moment. The app completely allows kids to be creative an explorative in the digital world by customising your own characters and taking your own approaches to certain challenges, but also feeling like your real life work pays off.",

These fields combined with Devine is a great combination for me. \n\nI have learned to view problems and situations with a more critical and creative eye. \nMy learning curve has been to always look for the right solutions and to learn from mistakes in order to think/act in a problem-solving way. I have always included these insights in future projects. Listening to the needs of the customer and being flexible towards changes are also important.\n\nIn addition, I have also experienced that I like working with people. \nDeveloping creative and inventive projects together is my drive for the future.

I love experimenting and reiterating to give people the best digital experience they can have, even if it takes a few errors along the way. By breaking a rule here and there and experimenting is how I try to make my projects just that little more unique.\n\nIn the future I want to keep developing my skills in storytelling and UX/UI design, but I also want to explore some of the (3D) motion design world.",

When looking at the existing platforms we found that they are all the same and very boring, so we wanted to find a more interactive and fun way.\nSo we came up with the idea to get to know the user first with the use of a tinder-like swiper and then generate a bathroom which they then can modify to their preferences. This way the user doesn’t have to start creating a bathroom from 0 and go through those boring steps.\nIn de real-life shop users can use AR to get the feeling of how their bathroom feels in a real space, they can also move the items around in the room using cubes.",

Towards the end of my projects I chose to apply this method which I am happy about, because it helped me create a more balanced life.

Image tracking and body recognition models were used to provide interaction within the experience; on the one hand with the user and on the other with the scenery. \n \nTwo types of scenery were delivered: A donut scene and a chess scene. The donut scene contained a 2D composition of the famous Michelangelo painting “The Creation of Adam”, 3D sprinkles and a donut. This creates an illusion of holding the donut and spreading the sprinkles by god's hands. The chess scene contained a 2D pattern of a chessboard in perspective and 3D chess pieces tracking the hand of the user. The 3D flows from the 2D decor to create an interesting setting in which the AR effectively has an added value making the result(ing) picture perfect.",

With this project we want kids to enjoy nature again, we want to do this by using digital components as our friend and not as the enemy. The digital world is often seen as the culprit, but we think that through the digital we can send people back to nature.\n\nWe invented a game where kids can relax, but once they are playing too long, we send them outside. We do this by giving the kids assignments throughout playing the game.\n\nThe idea behind our concept is that we send kids outside and they reconnect with the world. They see how much fun being outside is and they want to keep coming back.\nIf the kids want to go outside, we also get the parents outside, two birds with one stone.\n\nWe also used Arduino to connected physical object with the game. This way they have something to play with, beside the game itself. These physical objects are characters that we have linked with the game. You can get these characters by going outside and participate in events, organised by Natuurpunt (SNU!T) itself. This is another way to get the kids outside.",

Years later, when I was introduced to Devine by a friend, I was immediately drawn back into that world. I thought I was going to focus mainly on design, but Devine made me discover my love for programming. Even though it wasn't always easy, I kept going and I'm happy where I ended up now. The nice thing about Devine is that you still get to be creative, even if you focus on programming. That way you have the best of both worlds.",

            "description": "Our project is called Play Outside The Box. It is an answer to the research question we received from our client Natuurpunt: “How can we trigger children to play more often outdoors.” So we created a Proof of Concept Digital boardgame that is played outside in your garden or in the nearby forest. Take the Ipad with you and play it with your friends or family. The boardgame challenges the children to interact with the nature around them and it is a good mix of a fun digital boardgame and outdoor activities.\n\nWe created 2 teams that formed ‘the red thread’ through the boardgame. For those 2 teams, we created 2 characters who challenged the children with the outdoor activities. Team 1 is a bat, he is very playful and daring, as are his assignments/activities. Team 2 is a bunny and is the opposite. With this method we try to reach a wide range of children, which was a requirement of our client.\n\nWith those 2 teams and a lot of other fun game mechanics, the game gets a fully fun experience to play for children. Our focus in our project is animation. We want to bring the characters (and the whole boardgame) to life! This is how we keep the children's attention and make it visually appealing. The outdoor activities are always explained with a short animated film. So the children know what to do. And by completing challenges/activities, they earn points to win the boardgame!",

With the concept store we want to ensure that consumers are inspired, that everything can be configured and that service is guaranteed.\nWith the Bathroom Studio platform we try to captivate the consumer through our Robath campaign. Robath is a Robot that the consumer composes on the platform and gives character traits. Based on the Robath articles are automatically selected to reach the consumer's dream bathroom. The consumer can also choose from a wide range of selected installers. And after the order the consumer can follow up their order in the track and trace window.

Here they are free to discover the many assets, learn about their history and how they affect one another and play with parameters to change the environmental conditions of the domain. \n\nThese parameters are then translated to a physical installation that uses projection mapping on the real-life linden tree. In this onsite part of the experience: ‘Tilia Through Time’ users see how the life of Tilia would unfold if she were to be exposed to their custom environment.\n\nThis project was ordered by a real client. This client wanted that we made people aware about the fact, that if we keep on going to design things only for humans and not for different organisms. There are going to be a lot more ecological crisis.  \n\nThat’s why we choose this concept to show to people which good or bad influence you can have around you. And that everything is connected in a way within nature. ",

The continuously changing lights invite people to play with colors and movements every step of the way. Lights are calculated and distances measured to create a fun experience, with beautiful pictures in mind. By allowing the people to change the colors of the room we answer to the question of an interactive environment. The meticulously selected color palette and sound system create a holiday ethos that allows the visitor to relax and break free of any worries in a time of lockdowns and uncertainties.",

They wanted us to come up with a more interactive way of pitching, how can the broadcasters experience it from the first moment? \nWe had to come up with a visual identity of the program, a teaser, a pitch deck and an interactive experience. I decided to make a small version of the program and put it in a web application so the broadcasters could try out the program themselves. Since it’s a program with different rounds I decided to put a bit of every round into the experience so they can learn about all the rounds in a quick way, since it’s still a pitch. I worked in 3D because this way the items and room were a bit more realistic, and the broadcasters could imagine how the program would look.\nFor the Pitch deck I wanted to create something more interesting than a standard PowerPoint. I wanted the viewer to be able to visually see how every round works and so also have the feeling of being in the game. With some animations they would be guided through every round smoothly. \nI used the 3D items over the whole project in order to continue the design. It was a challenging but fun project because we had to imagine how the program would look as it’s not made yet and just a concept.",

I just knew I was somewhat creative and initially joined to learn animation. Throughout the years I learned new skills and how to express my creativity and that Design was something for me. I learned that there are many ways to create and design, and many different styles to try out. I have yet to find my own style, but I enjoy trying out and experimenting with the different styles.\nI’m always looking at things that could inspire me and learn how some things are made to add to my skillset. Since design changes over time, you always learn new things and it is not repetitive work, which I love.",

But this traditional tree is mostly passive, people walk by it without noticing (besides the presents). How to take the Christmas tree a step further? How can I give the Christmas tree a contemporary interpretation with today's technology? Let's connect, interact, and create happiness.\n\nFrom your cell phone or computer, you will be able to send messages to your own, or someone else Connectree. These can be text messages, creative drawings, and webcam motion effects. This connected Christmas tree is made for friends or family who cannot celebrate Christmas together. Or for people who are tired of a regular passive tree and want something new, something with more interaction and advanced features.\n\nIf you send a message to someone else’s Connectree, this message will be formed in the lights of the tree. By every incoming text message, there will be a physical bell ring. You can also make a drawing and send it to the Connectree, choose your favorite color and send a nice sketch to someone else's tree to surprise them. You can also use this feature to play Pictionary together. As a final option, you can send “motion” to the tree. Through webcam tracking, your body is mirrored in the led’s of the tree. ",

My studies allow me to gain insights in design (my creative and crazy part) and in programming and coding (my analytical part).
