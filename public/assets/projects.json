I actually was a bit afraid of programming and development, but it wasn't long before I developed a huge passion for coding as well.

In the future, I see myself delving further into the world of codes and creating interesting digital experiences.","profilePicture":{"data":{"id":"181","attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/wouter/image/upload/v1660750067/graduation_show_howest/amber_964d19ff83.jpg","width":1920,"height":1920,"mime":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"id":"4","attributes":{"firstName":"Antje","lastName":"Notteboom","curriculum":{"data":{"id":"8","attributes":{"name":"Devine","image":{"data":null},"pillar":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Pink","color":"fcbac5"}}}}}},"bio":"When I started Devine, I had no experience with anything, I didn’t know the programs and had never designed a thing. I just knew I was somewhat creative and initially joined to learn animation. Throughout the years I learned new skills and how to express my creativity and that Design was something for me. I learned that there are many ways to create and design, and many different styles to try out. I have yet to find my own style, but I enjoy trying out and experimenting with the different styles.\nI’m always looking at things that could inspire me and learn how some things are made to add to my skillset. Since design changes over time, you always learn new things and it is not repetitive work, which I love.","profilePicture":{"data":{"id":"182","attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/wouter/image/upload/v1660750083/graduation_show_howest/antje_e4567fe6a0.jpg","width":1920,"height":1920,"mime":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"id":"5","attributes":{"firstName":"Bavo","lastName":"Ingelaere","curriculum":{"data":{"id":"8","attributes":{"name":"Devine","image":{"data":null},"pillar":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Pink","color":"fcbac5"}}}}}},"bio":"I came to Devine as a kid who liked to draw and listen to stories. This was the only experience I had. Other subjects, especially development, were very intimidating at first. Fortunately, I could really ease into any part of their curriculum and I quickly developed a liking for JavaScript and other languages. I’ve also been able to dive deeper into my skills as an illustrator and motion designer. Now I love combining my knowledge of coding and my expertise in animation to create meaningful, digital experiences and interactive stories, both on the web or installations.","profilePicture":{"data":{"id":"183","attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/wouter/image/upload/v1660750097/graduation_show_howest/bavo_5c606a5c1b.jpg","width":1920,"height":1920,"mime":"image/jpeg"}}}}},{"id":"6","attributes":{"firstName":"Bert","lastName":"Meeuws","curriculum":{"data":{"id":"8","attributes":{"name":"Devine","image":{"data":null},"pillar":{"data":{"attributes":{"name":"Pink","color":"fcbac5"}}}}}},"bio":"During my education at Devine, I had the opportunity to experiment with different things in design and development.\nI finally found my passion for programming during the personal passion project in the second year. In hindsight, Devine may not have been the best choice of study, but I am glad I gave it a try.\nThe different skills I learned from pitching and researching a product are things I will take with me in the future.\nFor me, Devine was a struggle because I was good at only one thing but eventually I got there in the end.\nI am glad that it is done and that I can focus fully on my great passion: programming.

When creating a digital product, I try to look beyond a keyboard and screen, I love to experiment with the web and technology. My studies allow me to gain insights in design (my creative and crazy part) and in programming and coding (my analytical part).

That is because I have always been an impulsive decision maker. Sometimes this is not that good but this time it was very good. So I could never imagine what an amazing journey it was going to be. After the first lessons I was sold, for the first time in my life I loved going to school. And was always excited to learn new things. At first my goal was to be a designer but as I learned more and more the development side of things peaked my interested.

I thought I was going to focus mainly on design, but Devine made me discover my love for programming. Even though it wasn't always easy, I kept going and I'm happy where I ended up now. The nice thing about Devine is that you still get to be creative, even if you focus on programming. That way you have the best of both worlds.","profilePicture":{"data":{"id":"179","attributes":{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/wouter/image/upload/v1660749900/graduation_show_howest/alexander_v_27903ec86c.jpg","width":1920,"height":1920,"mime":"image/jpeg"}}}}}]}}}
