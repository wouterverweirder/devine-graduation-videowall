      "description": "For the 900th anniversary of Kuurne, we created an interactive installation that tells the tale of one of Kuurne's most cherished themes, the Kuurne Donkeys!\n\nBy placing a life-size interactive clock in the center of an installation, we take a closer look at the donkey's past, present, and future. Visitors are invited to spin the arm of the clock and explore each era through 3 different animated videos. In doing so, we entertain and teach visitors about the meaning of the Donkey and let young & old learn more about the legends of their beloved town!\n\nTo let people learn and explore more freely, we also created 3 side installations that each pair up with one of the 3 time periods. Visitors can play 'the Donkey Race', look for a 'Medal in a Haystack', or even take their own 'Donkey King Selfie'! This way, they can freely interact and learn more about each story with their friends and family.\n\nWe believe that the people of Kuurne will get to learn even more about their beloved town & we hope that they will be proud to always be a Kuurne Donkey!",

Each keystroke sets an animation in motion that flows through a construction of LED strips and culminates in an exploding visual on one of the 3 screens. We gave the user creative control over the output of the installation by providing a button that changes both the sound of the piano and the accompanying visual style of the on-screen animations.\nThis project aims to speak to the creativity of music lovers and provide them with an interactive outlet as entertainment in the setting of the waiting area of a concert venue during a city festival.",

We chose a room in the Rectory House and filled it in as a time machine, where the visitor travels from the present to 900 years in the future of Kuurne. To introduce the present, we made a graphic novel starring the well-known former inhabitant of Kuurne, Ever Meulen, as the main character. In this story, we recount the strange occurrences in the rectory house, one of which reads that all people ever to enter the house have gone missing. This story ends with a cliffhanger that leads the visitor to the second part of the room, which depicts the future. Here we display the end result obtained by the co-creation, where we illustrated Kuurne within 900 years through the eyes of the inhabitants of Kuurne themselves. As an extra game to make the whole ordeal more interactive, there is a missing persons folder in which all the well-known Kuurnenaars who have gotten lost in the future are depicted. It is the task of the visitor to look for these people and check the box next to their names once found. Lastly, postcards can also be found in the second room, which has a futuristic depiction on the front and an explanation of how that specific aspect came to be on the back.",

You have been using your body since the day you were born, so why not use it as an in-game controller? We made this possible by using a technology called motion tracking together with the Kinect.\n\nThe game will undoubtedly provide you with a good time! Choose a character and immerse yourself in the digital world. Try and dodge all the objects that are coming at you! Jump, duck or move to the side and watch your in-game character follow every movement you make.\n\nTry beating other people’s time or play against each other in teams! \nHave fun, but watch out, because when all your lives are gone, it’s game over!",

      "description": "We made a game called Banana Flip for our bachelor project. Players control an inflatable banana that they can move up and down to control the flipper within a pinball machine. The goal is to progress through the game by using the banana to hit targets like a dangerous crocodile and overcome obstacles within the machine to find a hidden gem. Banana Flip is designed for kids between the ages of 6 and 12 and is meant to be both fun and educational. One of the key learning objectives of the game is to introduce children to the concept of virtual pinball games. We made this possible with Arduino and Phaser.js. Overall, this game is a great way for kids to learn about what’s possible to make with technology, see some entertaining game design, and have fun while doing it!",

This project aims to shine the light again on flax in Kuurne. In an old vicarage, a visitor can experience the past, present and future each through a different digital presentation method. A 3D 360-degree video allows the visitor to relive the flax-to-linen process. A designed slide show shows the state of the flax industry today, and future applications of flax are shown through out self-made hologram box. \n\nTo present these three stages I’ve opted to mix the old and the new. Old tools and linen products set the scene, whilst digital presentation methods blend in perfectly. It also refers to my own relationship with my girlfriend, a textile designer (old industry) and me as a digital designer (new industry).",

By taking a journey with the Ibon suitcase, you will learn how it works and why this is the suitcase of the future. With our social media campaign \"Expect Innovation\" we want to trigger people to visit the website to try out the suitcase without physically seeing it. Throughout the various chapters, we encourage people to experience the suitcase for themselves. Because we show videos through the process, it is easier to visualise it.

      "description": "900 years Kuurne commissioned us to fill one room with an installation on the history of this city.\nAs a cycling fan, I immediately thought of Kuurne Brussel Kuurne and did not let that go.\n\nThe aim of my project is to inform visitors indirectly about the history of this race.\nIn a playful way, I put the user in the position of a legend of Kuurne Brussels Kuurne to \nride a historical stage.\n\nThis game is controlled by a physical bike that the user sits on. Here, the bicycle is the controller of the program. By cycling faster and by making the right choices at obstacles, you cycle through the three cores of Kuurne towards the finish line. Look carefully around you as the background can help you solve obstacles.\n\nDo you have what it takes to become a legend?",

      "description": "Wilde Westen is an event organizer based in Kortrijk. Every year they organise a lot of different events and one of them is DAK. This event is located on the roof of venue de Kreun and takes place during the Sinksen.\n\nBut there is a problem. Only 150 people can be on the roof at the same time, and since the people turning up exceeds this number, a line forms downstairs. The challenge for me was to entertain the attendees via a digital product. The solution? An interactive karaoke.\n\nThe experience was designed to be engaging and interactive. That’s why I chose to make motion visuals displayed on projectors to enhance the overall experience. While waiting you can vote on a wide selection of songs via an app on your phone and sing along while enjoying the dynamic visuals. The project was meant to be accessible and user-friendly, with easy-to-follow instructions displayed on screen to guide participants through the process. After each song, 4 random songs out of this wide selection will be displayed and the people can vote on their favourite one. The song with the most votes after 30 seconds will be queued next.\n\nThe motivation behind the karaoke project was to lighten the mood and create a fun and festive atmosphere for attendees while they waited. Singing is a well-known activity that can lift people's spirits and bring a sense of joy and celebration, and I wanted to use that to create a positive and enjoyable experience.",
